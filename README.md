# ImPO
Repository for the ImmunoPeptidomics Ontology (ImPO).

ImPO is an ontology designed with the purpose of encapsulating and systematizing data generated by immunopeptidomics experimental processes and bioinformatics analysis. ImPO is the first effort at standardizing the terminology and semantics in the immunopepticomics domain and establishes cross-references to 22 relevant ontologies, including the [NCIt](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ncit.owl), [MONDO](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo.owl), [LOINC](http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/LNC/), and [EFO](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/efo.owl).

ImPO was initiated in 2021 under the auspices of the [KATY Consortium](https://katy-project.eu/), supported by the EU programme Horizon 2020/H2020-SCI-FA-DTS-2020-1.

ImPO files are available in our GitHub repository as follows:
- Core ontology: [ImPO.owl](https://github.com/liseda-lab/ImPO/blob/main/ImPO.owl).
- Instance data used for validation through competency questions: [ImPOinds.rdf](https://github.com/liseda-lab/ImPO/blob/main/ImPOinds.rdf).
- Competency questions used to evaluate ImPO completeness: [ImPO_SPARQLcqs.txt](https://github.com/liseda-lab/ImPO/blob/main/ImPO_SPARQLcqs.txt).
- A folder with the rml files used for data integration into ImPO: [data_integration](https://github.com/liseda-lab/ImPO/tree/main/data_integration).
